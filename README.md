Create PI from other PI data
=========================

## Overview
This app example is a proof of concept of how to create a PortfolioItem from an existing PortfolioItem.
Per WS API documentation, PortfolioItem is a non-creatable type. To allow a flexibility of choosing any existing PI type, e.g. feature, initiative, or theme, the type is set dynamically in the app.
